                        At Blossoms Childcare, we provide fresh, nutritional, home-cooked meals within our fees. Children are encouraged to eat vegetables and fresh fruit every day which are locally sourced where possible. Our mealtimes are a social and interactive time of the day, where our team sits-down with the children 
                        to provide support, encouragement and role-model healthy eating
                            <br /><br />
                            Children help to cook and prepare meals and snacks where possible, and older children help to set the table, serve themselves,
                             and help tidy-away - all valuable life lessons which encourage independence and promote our values
                            <br /> <br />
                            
Our included varied snacks offer each child a healthy choice of food option and drink during the nursery day which they prepare at the table guided by a member of our team. This encourages every child to speak with confidence and choose for themselves, promoting independence. 
All children have unlimited access to water throughout the day.
                            <br /><br />
                            We cater for all special dietary requirements and this is

                                The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) is how the Government and Early Years describe the time in your child’s life between birth and the age of 5 years. 
                                This is a crucial time in your child’s life as it starts to sow the seeds for later learning, providing foundations for building future skills and learning. 
                                This stage also begins to get your child ready for school.
                                <br /><br />
                                We believe this stage of learning should be happy, child-led, fun, stimulating and rich in varied activities to 
                                help children develop their own sense-of-self and gain confidence to try and experience new things.

                                Your child’s Key Person will update you about their learning on a regular basis, providing feedback on your child’s learning and development. 
                                We hold regular meetings and provide written updates on their progress throughout each term, with daily information, “wow moments” and developmental progress shared with you via our online learning journey software.

                                After your child turns 2, we will provide a written summary of how your child is progressing against the 3 Prime Areas of learning: 
                                communication and language; physical development; and personal, social and emotional development. This is called the Progress Check at age 2. 
                                This check will highlight areas where your child is progressing well and anywhere they might need some extra help or support – plus how we can support family members or carers to work with the Key Person to help with a joined-up approach between nursery and home. 
                                You might find it useful to share the information from the check with other professionals, such as health visitors who can use it as part of their health and development review.

                                We carry out ongoing assessments that will tell you about your child’s progress through the EYFS, while we help your child to reach certain expected levels by 5 years old, or the end of the Reception Year; 
                                these expectations are called the Early Learning Goals (ELGs). It is our job to get your child ready for school.
