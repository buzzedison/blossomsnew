                            At Blossoms Childcare we strongly believe that working in partnership with our parents and families is the best way to help children develop. 
                            We will work with you to ensure we keep you updated with your child’s progress on every step of their journey with us, and ask that you would do the same.

                            On starting at Blossoms your child will be allocated a Key Person, this role is to help ensure that every child’s care is tailored to their individual needs and interests, 
                            in order to help them develop the best that they can. It is their role to help your child become familiar with the nursery environment and routines, 
                            developing a settled relationship for your child and for you. Your Key Person will provide 
                            feedback to you each day and offer support in your child’s development, while offering ideas for supporting their learning and development at home.
