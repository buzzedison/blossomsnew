These sessions don’t include any meal times, but they do include a healthy snack and any nappies. These sessions are designed for parents and carers who do not wish to pay any fees when additional care costs are incurred. We
                            don’t charge a Registration Fee for these sessions, but we still provide children’s uniforms. We ask that you give us a month’s notice of any changes. (As with all spaces, these are subject to availability.)</p>
