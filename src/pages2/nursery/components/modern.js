                        In general, what all of these theorists have in common is putting the child at the centre of learning, with play-based learning in a natural and free-flowing environment, while encouraging their development at the pace of the individual child.
                        <br /><br />
                        They all promote the innate curiosity and thirst for learning that children exhibit and foster a sense of child-led learning with adults/teachers/parents scaffolding the children’s learning journeys in ways that allow for children to learn from their own experiences and from their own mistakes.
                        <br /> <br />
                        Children learn best from themselves, not from structured lessons, and adults (parents and teachers) should observe more than they direct, only getting involved when they can expand on a child’s learning without stopping their play – adults should provide the resources and the environment to enrich learning through play.
                        <br />   <br />
                        They all suggest that children benefit from a healthy surrounding as much as they do from a positive role-model, and learn best when allowed to follow their own curiosity, while being cared for in a safe and stimulating setting. While good educators and caregivers can make a big difference, nothing can replace the impact of a well laid out and resourced environment that allows children to have a choice of imaginative and free-flowing play. Adults without the environment are simply caregivers; an environment without adults is a playground; an environment with adults facilitates learning through play. As Piaget suggested: children are scientific investigators and need a world to explore.
                        <br /><br />
                        Outdoor, free-flow play is also paramount. The outdoors provides a connection to nature alongside a wealth of opportunities for exploration and imaginative play, all with the benefit that fresh air brings.
