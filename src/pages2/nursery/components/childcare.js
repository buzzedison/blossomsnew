                                    children’s development benefits enormously from spending more of their formative years
                                    learning through play with dedicated childcare practitioners, while spending more time
                                    learning to socialise with their peers.</p>

We take lessons from history’s childcare pioneers and practice modern childcare that follows the EYFS.</p>

Why is learning through play ‘our thing’ these days? What has influenced this method of rearing children in society?</p>
