        {name:'Froebel',text:(<Fragment><p>It can be argued that the first structured childcare (and something far beyond the typical workhouse for children of the time), where children were given the freedom to express themselves, play and learn in a healthy environment, was Froebel’s Play and Activity Institute – later more aptly named the Kindergarten (Child – Garden), formed in 1837.</p> <p>Friedrich Froebel was the first to create a playful childcare setting, and was the focus and inspiration of many others who have shaped childcare philosophy with their theories over thelast century.</p><p>His creation had three essential ingredients: creative play, which he called gifts and occupations, singing and dancing for healthy activity and observing and nurturing plants in a garden for stimulating awareness of the natural world.</p><p>Froebel said of his ‘gifts’ and ‘occupations’:</p><p>"The gifts are intended to give the child from time to time new universal aspects of the external world, suited to a child's development. The occupations, on the other hand, furnish material for practice in certain phases of the skill.</p><p>"Nothing but the First Gift can so effectively arouse in the child's mind the feeling and consciousness of a world of individual things; but there are numberless occupations that will enable the child to become skilful in the manipulation of surfaces.</p><p>"The gift leads to discovery; the occupation to invention. The gift gives insight; the occupation, power.</p><p>"The occupations are one-sided; the gifts, many-sided, universal. The occupations touch only certain phases of being; the gifts enlist the whole being of the child."</p><p><b>Froebel Summary:</b></p><p>It is easy to see how modern nurseries are influenced by his Kindergarten, but people have taken this further and added to the ingredients and shaped how childcare provisions deliver their learning through play today. Today we focus on a much more holistic approach to early years, where the child is at the heart of everything we do. We shape our environments to enhance children’s learning through their individual interests whether this is indoors or outdoors, singing and dancing or exploring minibeasts.</p></Fragment>)},
        {name:'Bruce',text:(<Fragment><p>Tina Bruce was influenced by Froebel but decided to argue that instead of learning through play, children practice what they&rsquo;ve learned in their play.</p> <p>She said regarding her theory:</p> <p>&ldquo;Play transforms children because it helps them to function beyond the here and now. They can become involved in more abstract thinking about the past, using the past, and into imagining the future, or alternative ways of doing things. It helps them to problem solve, and to experiment. It helps them to work out what they think and feel.&rdquo;</p><p>Bruce theorised that there were 12 Features of Play:</p><p>1. Children use first hand experiences from life.<br />
            2. Children make up rules as they play in order to keep control.<br />
            3. Children symbolically represent as they play, making and adapting play props.<br />
            4. Children choose to play &ndash; they cannot be made to play.<br />
            5. Children rehearse their future in their role play.<br />
            6. Children sometimes play alone.<br />
            7. Children pretend when they play.<br />
            8. Children play with adults and other children cooperatively in pairs or groups.<br />
            9. Children have a personal play agenda, which may or may not be shared.<br />
            10. Children are deeply involved and difficult to distract from their deep learning as they wallow in their play and learning.<br/>
            11. Children try out their most recently acquired skills and competences, as if celebrating what they know.<br/>
            12. Children coordinate ideas and feelings and make sense of relationships with their families, friends and cultures.</p>
            <p>Bruce also wrote about there being 10 Principles of Early Childhood Education:</p>
            <p>1. The best way to prepare children for their adult life is to give them what they need as children.</p>
            <p>2. Children are whole people who have feelings, ideas and relationships with others, and who need to be physically, mentally, morally and spiritually healthy. </p>
            <p>3. Subjects such as mathematics and art cannot be separated; young children learn in an integrated way and not in neat, tidy compartments.</p>
            <p>4. Children learn best when they are given appropriate responsibility, allowed to make errors, decisions and choices, and respected as autonomous learners.</p>
            <p>5. Self-discipline is emphasised. Indeed, this is the only kind of discipline worth having. Reward systems are very short-term and do not work in the long-term. Children need their efforts to be valued.</p>
            <p>6. There are times when children are especially able to learn particular things.</p>
            <p>7. What children can do (rather that what they cannot do) is the starting point of a child’s education.</p>
            <p>8. Imagination, creativity and all kinds of symbolic behaviour (reading, writing, drawing, dancing, music, mathematical numbers, algebra, role play and talking) develop and emerge when conditions are favourable.</p>
            <p>9. Relationships with other people (both adults and children) are of central importance in a child’s life.</p>
            <p>10. Quality education is about three things: the child, the context in which learning takes place, and the knowledge and understanding which the child develops and learns.</p>
            <p><b>Bruce Summary:</b></p>
            <p>Bruce teaches us that children like to continue developing their own skills through play, practicing what they’ve learned, and learning to understand their world through play. We can see how her ideas still shape the nursery environment today. We offer props to encourage role-play, open-ended resources such as pebbles which can become apples, dinosaurs or used for counting. We teach children to respect each other and their environment where they can use their own ideas to capture their curiosity and develop their play alone or with others. Adults are on hand to support their play by interacting in their games whilst also understanding the need to step back and observe to allow some children to take responsibility for their open choices, decisions and resolve their own problems and conflicts, thus providing them with the necessary tools to develop essential life skills.</p>

        {name:'Moyles',text:(<Fragment><p>Janet Moyles’ Spiral Theory argued that children should be allowed to play freely first, then structured, then freely. Her theory was that the structured play would allow for some teaching about their play, which children would then explore in the free play to practice their new-found skills.</p> 
            <p><b>Moyles Summary:</b></p>
            <p>From Moyles we learn that playful teaching helps to add some structure to children’s playful learning by scaffolding and advancing their learning journey and helping them to strengthen their skills as they learn. You can see Moyles’ influence in the EYFS when we plan a child’s next steps in-the-moment but also noting future next-steps based on a child’s interests and progress with their learning. For example, a child may wish to use a pair of scissors, they may persevere to try and use them, but to keep their engagement and focus an adult may need to model how to use them, then allow them to try again. In some areas of development children need some structure in order to help them understand how to play and what they can achieve with some support, then children should be free to explore this for themselves, for example counting and reading stories are essential to school readiness but without some adult support these opportunities would be lost. A child can look at the pictures in a book, but without some structure of an adult reading it to them, they would never know about the true meaning of the story, its characters or that books have a beginning, middle and an end. What we must do is find a balance in a child’s education to give them the freedom to then make up their own stories from what they have listened too.</p>

        {name:'Steiner',text:(
            <Fragment>
                <p>Rudolf Steiner believed in the idea of developing the whole person, looking beyond practical and academic skills, and considered how to develop what he deemed to be spiritual values and social skills. He developed a spiritual movement he called anthroposophy, which is based on the idea that a child’s moral, spiritual and creative sides need as much attention as their intellect. This could be called the beginning of working on Personal, Social and Emotional development within childcare, alongside more practical and academic teaching. He also included working on Physical Development as an important part of child development and learning.</p>
                <p><b>Steiner Summary:</b></p>
                <p>Steiner taught us that children get more than an academic base by learning through play; children start to benefit physically and emotionally as well as working on their communication skills by taking less of a classroom approach and more of a holistic approach. He also taught us that a child can benefit from longer term relationships with Key Persons who travel along a child’s learning journey with them, giving them a stable, secure attachment to aid their exploration and learning. Dolls, books, puppets and props help to promote the Steiner approach; allowing children to talk about feelings, act-out roles and develop their emotions all contribute to enabling children to begin understanding how they feel and develop empathy. For example, instead of telling a child off, you might give a doll a persona, and in a group session tell the children that the doll is sad today because someone ripped up its picture; the children get to explore others’ feelings and empathy without the need for the child-perpetrator to be told off for doing it, and allowing them and the other children to learn more from the experience, learning right from wrong without negative experiences, instead positively encouraging and role-modelling; teaching children that what they do affects others, and teaching them that they are a part of a wider community – a more philosophical approach to learning.</p>

        {name:'Montessori',text:(
            <Fragment>
                <p>Maria Montessori theorised there were 4 planes of development phases covering birth to 24 years, and believed that adults should not laden children with learning from above, instead that adults should allow children to learn by their enthusiasm and at their own rate, while adults should be there to provide the resources and environment for curious learning, and be there to assist and help when necessary instead of force-feeding the knowledge. She also believed that learning should encompass all aspects of development instead of trying to achieve specific learning of information.</p>
                <p>Her educational method was based on a few main premises:</p>
                <p>Respect for the child:</p>
                <p>She believed that adults rarely respected children. She argued that adults expect children to be disciplined and that they force information on children from above. Her approach allows children to have choices, which she argues help to prepare them to be independent learners. She theorised that children discover the world around them through a hands-on approach, rather than the information being landed upon them from above. Facilitating choices and a hands-on approach to learning promotes enthusiasm and curiosity driven learning.</p>
                <p>The Absorbent Mind:</p>
                <p>Montessori stated that children are constantly learning in an inherent process of their everyday life, and that what children absorb is heavily dependent upon the types of information and experiences that cross their paths. A Montessori classroom allows for free exploration and learning in uninterrupted blocks of time, in order to get the most out of a child’s learning experiences.</p>
                <p>Sensitive periods:</p>
                <p>Her theory suggested children become ripe to learn different types of skills at specific points in their development, however, the age at which each sensitive period occurs is different for each child. She said that teachers must be acutely aware of when the right time is to introduce concepts to each individual child.</p>
                <p>The prepared environment:</p>
                <p>Montessori classrooms are prepared differently to traditional ones. She believed that classrooms should be filled with readily available and well organised learning materials in an aesthetically pleasing environment, and should only include things that the teacher wants the child to experience. A Montessori learning environment should contain materials that children of differing ages, characteristics, and interests can all engage with.</p>
                <p>Auto-education:</p>
                <p>Montessori believed that children should educate themselves, helping them to develop the necessary skills for life. She argued that this was possible if the teacher had prepared an appropriate learning environment and offered choices. Her theory suggested letting children learn in multi-age groups, enabling them to assist each other in their learning processes. Auto-education can be seen as the goal of the Montessori method.</p>
                <p>From Montessori we learn that during the first plane, ‘infancy’, between the ages of birth to 6 years old, a child has an Absorbent Mind and has several Sensitive Periods during which time learning is intense and enlightening. Between birth and 3 years old, a child has an unconscious Absorbent Mind learning through their senses, whereas between 3 and 6 years old, the child learns consciously through active hands-on experiences. We learn that during these early years, children learn best when they are allowed to do things on their own.</p>
                <p>Montessori also believed in having particular resources that enabled a wide variety of play from each individual object; if you give a child a toy, it can only be used in one particular way, but if you give a child an object, they can use it to create their own play in a variety of different ways, which can aid in their cognitive, social and emotional development.</p>
                <p><b>Montessori Summary:</b></p>
                <p>You can see Montessori’s influence in the EYFS when we look at the section of enabling environments. As practitioners, we learn to meticulously plan our environment with well organised resources where children can develop their imagination and learning through open-ended props. The Montessori approach teaches us to have wooden bricks for children to build their own castle instead of a pink barbie house which can only ever be a barbie house. The key objective is to provide objects which spark interest and encourage children to make their own play - alone or with others - where they can play imaginatively, and represent objects with natural materials, encouraging all seven areas of learning, prime and specific hand-in-hand instead of approaching areas of development individually.</p>

        {name:'McMillan',text:(
            <Fragment>
                <p>Margaret McMillan believed that children learn by exploring and achieve their full potential through first-hand experience and active learning, through free play, where children had access to a wide range of materials, particularly craft materials and water activities. She believed that outdoor play and fresh air was very important, and advocated healthy eating, stressing the importance of balanced meals so that children were ready to learn. (Her work was also instrumental in the future creation of the school dinner.) She also believed that parents have a never-ending influence on their children’s learning. Her method involved having a focus on outdoor garden spaces, with no formal structure to the day, although regular meals and sleep times were key parts of the day alongside time to run and play, and freely explore the outdoor gardens; her classrooms were called ‘shelters’ and even these had balconies and windows that folded back to make the rooms as light and airy as possible to make the most of the outdoors even when they had to shelter from the weather.</p>
                <p><b>McMillan Summary:</b></p>
                <p>From McMillan we learn that the outdoor classroom is a part of the indoor classroom, and vice-versa; the idea that children can learn just as much outside as inside the classroom. This approach revolutionised early years and made the outdoors an extension of the classroom. Children were allowed to be free and use the outdoor area to explore and learn from nature. Children were allowed free-flow play and could choose their own environment. Many nurseries adopt this approach today with free-flow play all day round, with the only structured time being for meals. This allows the children to have uninterrupted play and more recently saw the introduction of rolling snack-time. The opportunity for children to come and sit down for a snack when they were ready rather than a formalised time. The concept of uninterrupted play allows children to feel in control of their play and not bound by time limits or by adults. Settings can also adopt working-mats where a child can put whatever they are doing onto a mat, which is then left alone for the child to return to after meal times, so that children ‘own’ their play, and adults don’t stop their learning-through-play mid-way.</p>

        {name:'Reggio Emilia',text:(
            <Fragment>
                <p>Reggio Emilia, a post-World War 2 town in Italy, has influenced modern childcare with a very tight-knit relationship between the childcare providers and the parents of the children. The Reggio Emilia Philosophy values the child as strong, capable and resilient. It has three core principles: the child, the environment, and the teacher, and leans on a child’s innate curiosity, aiming to assist them with understanding the world and who they are within it.</p>
                <p>The child is central to their own learning, not an empty vessel waiting to be filled with knowledge by adults, and encouraged to use every tool they have to express themselves.</p>
                <p>Environments are free-flowing spaces seen as ‘the third teacher’, where children can explore uninterrupted, playing while learning, preferably with an outdoor space that is easily accessed from the indoor space.</p>
                <p>Teachers (and parents) are observers not directors of play, allowing children to experiment, make mistakes and find solutions on their own. After lengthy observations teachers may guide and encourage children toward areas of learning that may interest them, then fall back to observing positions.</p>
                <p><b>Reggio Emilia Summary:</b></p>
                <p>From Reggio Emilia we learn that it is important for parents to play a role in their child’s educational development. You can see Reggio Emilia’s influence in our Nursery with the daily use of online communications, and end of session de-briefs, to share childrens’ experiences at the nursery with their parents. We involve them in their education by encouraging parents to work on the next-steps with their child to further develop them at home alongside their progress at nursery, and for parents to share their experiences from home with us at the nursery to ensure a comprehensive and tied-up approach to nurturing each individual. It also relies on the child having a secure base to feel happy enough to explore the world around them; they need to feel safe and supported in order to thrive and therefore the adult/parent/caregiver attachment and relationship is key to helping them learn.</p>

        {name:'Forest Schools',text:(
            <Fragment>
                <p>The Forest School Approach supports play, exploration and supported risk taking in outdoor-centric learning environments. It argues that an outside space is not just somewhere children go to burn off energy, and that the divide between indoors and outdoors is removed to encourage children to learn in and from nature. Children are given the freedom to direct their own learning and enter into a certain amount of ‘risky-play’, which in turn increases their sense of engagement and motivation. The outdoor space should have a wide variety of activities on offer to provide the children with a sense of independence, which can have very positive effects on a child’s intellectual, cognitive, physical and emotional development. The outdoor environment can help to build a child’s self-esteem and confidence, and provide a springboard for numerous academic pursuits later in life, as it ticks every area of learning.</p>
                <p>The Forest School Approach has 6 key principles and 7 core beliefs.</p>
                <p>The 6 key principles are:</p>
                <p>1. Forest School is a long-term process of regular sessions, rather than one-off or infrequent visits; the cycle of planning, observation, adaptation and review links each session.</p>
                <p>2. Forest School takes place in a woodland or natural environment to support the development of a lifelong relationship between the learner and the natural world.</p>
                <p>3. Forest School uses a range of learner-centred processes to create a community for being, development and learning.</p>
                <p>4. Forest School aims to promote the holistic development of all involved, fostering resilient, confident, independent and creative learners.</p>
                <p>5. Forest School offers learners the opportunity to take supported risks appropriate to the environment and to themselves.</p>
                <p>6. Forest School is run by qualified Forest School practitioners, who continuously maintain and develop their professional practice.</p>
                <p><b>The 7 core beliefs are, that learners are all:</b></p>
                <p>1. equal, unique and valuable</p>
                <p>2. competent to explore & discover</p>
                <p>3. entitled to experience appropriate risk and challenge</p>
                <p>4. entitled to choose, and to initiate and drive their own learning and development</p>
                <p>5. entitled to experience regular success</p>
                <p>6. entitled to develop positive relationships with themselves and other people and</p>
                <p>7. entitled to develop a strong, positive relationship with their natural world.</p>
                <p><b>Forest School Summary:</b></p>
                <p>Forest School ideas and philosophies don’t have to be limited to childcare settings in woodland areas with a wooden shack to shelter in – the lessons learned from this approach can be applied in any setting, even those with limited outdoor space; spending time outdoors as much as possible and connecting with nature is an important part of a child’s development, bringing with it risk-taking, exploration and independence. It is vitally important that children are allowed to take risks and have responsibility for small tasks in order to help them problem solve, build self-esteem and a sense of self. It is also important that a setting allows for the indoor space to be connected to the outdoor space with free-flow access throughout the day, to allow the children to be independent in their choice of play.</p>
