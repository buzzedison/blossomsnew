                        Children are born with an immediate desire to explore and play, and they don’t need any encouragement or rewards from their peers or adults to do so. However, skilled practitioners at Blossoms Childcare will take this innate drive and strengthen children’s development.

                            Animal babies play to hone their skills, like puppies and kittens play-hunting to master skills they will need when they are older, and like animals, baby humans also play to develop their understanding of the world around them and learn how to utilise their body’s movement in play.
                            <br /><br />
                            Children find play enjoyable and pleasurable, and it is something they do for its own sake. From a very early age it helps them to learn through investigation and experimentation; helps them to practise existing skills and develop new ones; allows them to act out scenarios; helps them to understand and explain events; helps them to develop social skills; helps them to experience feelings such as frustration and disappointment, and satisfaction and joy; and helps them to make sense of the world around them.
