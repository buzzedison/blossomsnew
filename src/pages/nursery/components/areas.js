                            <p class="mt-3">Outdoor spaces are an invaluable part of your child’s learning, and we use ours daily whatever the weather! Children benefit from free-flow indoor-outdoor play, and our environment is set-up to be interesting, engaging, challenging and fun for all ages.</p>
                            <p>Blossoms Childcare is set within a landscaped environment with trees and fresh air in abundance. Children get to explore all seasons and weather to teach them about changes, growth and life-cycles throughout the year. Our outdoor space is an extension of our learning environment with lots of opportunities to develop language, turn-taking, mark-making, numbers, counting and forming relationships. From our mud kitchen - where children can let their imagination run wild making mud pies, work with others to create and develop their own ideas - to learning how to grow vegetables and care for plants and living things, we ensure all of our children are positively challenged while learning through play outdoors.</p>
                            <p>We have a large enclosed garden area which is primarily artificial-grass with some muddy areas for exploring and digging. Children can enjoy the sand-pits connected by a pulley system for transporting between them, the water-features to explore flowing water, barked and woodland areas for children to experience nature, wildlife and mini beasts, a bird-watching hut with children’s binoculars, some balance beams and climbing frames to
                                develop strength and balance, a growing patch for flowers and vegetables, various role-play areas for imaginative play, and the good old-fashioned mud kitchen.</p>
                            <p>Physical exercise, health and well-being are promoted within our daily routines with opportunities to take part in physical play developing gross motor skills and encouraging healthy living. There is also a large park with physical play equipment located within 5 minutes’ walking distance. We take regular trips within our local environment for children to learn about the local community and help develop their sense of identity and self within the
                                wider world.</p>

                            <p class="mt-3">Our environments are carefully planned to enable all children to develop at their own unique pace. We adapt our learning environments weekly to aid children's emerging interests and offer new and exciting challenges to help them on their journey.</p>
                            <p>Children need to be challenged and childcare providers should constantly update their activities and resources to keep children engaged while following their ever-evolving interests. At Blossoms Childcare, we excel in providing the encouragement to learn through play in an environment where no expense is spared to provide the perfect environment in which children can learn and develop through play.</p>
                            <p>We have role-play in the home-corner, vets-corner and shop-corner, ever-rotating craft activity tables to help children develop their fine-motor skills, maths areas, a reading library with soft rugs and cushions, construction zones and even a quiet area - all designed to keep children energised and interested while helping them to grow, develop and learn through play.</p>
