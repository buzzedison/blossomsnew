                            To work in childcare, and be counted in the legal adult:child ratios, you must be qualified to Level 3 or above. 
                            You can have a Level 2 and be counted in ratio, but you must be paired with a Level 3 to count.

                            At Blossoms, weâ€™re proud to have a dedicated team of professionals that are eager to learn and keep their practice up-to-date. 
                            Our team is considered highly qualified, and continually take-part in training and development, while we actively encourage our team to take on new
                            qualifications. We also like to ensure each member of our team is up-to-date with their Food Hygiene, Safeguarding and their Paediatric First Aid Certificate.
                            <br /><br />
                            In our team we have 5 Early Years Educators who are qualified to Level 5, and 3 members of our team who are qualified to Level 6 or higher, 
                            with one of those being a Qualified Teacher and one being a Qualified Early Years Teacher.
                            <br /><br />
                            More than half of our team are qualified to Level 5 or higher, and this high level of knowledge and experience in our team is of huge benefit to Apprentices, 
                            Level 3 colleagues and, more importantly, to the children attending our nursery.
