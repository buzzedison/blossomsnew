                                        Our garden is surrounded by an 8ft fence affording privacy and security while the children
                                        enjoy the outdoors, and our building is secured with locks on the external doors and
                                        windows, plus the internal partition doors. We also use a Digital Q-Bell door system for
                                        added security during drop-off and collection times. The nursery has strict policies and

                                        paramount to everything we do. We undertake regular reviews of all security. This includes:

                                        Failure to do so will mean we will not release your child until consent is received.

                                        All staff at Blossoms undergo a rigorous recruitment procedure when they start with us.

                                        This highlights any cautions, reprimands, final warnings or convictions they have on record, plus any additional information on their Police record considered relevant to their post. 
                                        We ask for a minimum of two references; one reference must be from their most recent employment. Any gaps in work history must be accounted for.
